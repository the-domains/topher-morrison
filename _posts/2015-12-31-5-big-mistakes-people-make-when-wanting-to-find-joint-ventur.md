As the information age dies out, and the collaboration age learns how to walk, more business owners are realizing the power of teaming up with people that, in the past, might have even been seen as competition, but by forming an alliance can move both business forward faster and bigger than they could on their own. 

Even major companies like telecom and cable companies are getting in on the trend and finding affiliates to help them promote their business to their current customer base's friends and families. 

If you are looking to create joint-venture partnerships with other businesses, you will soon discover that it's not as easy as just picking up the phone and offering them money for every sale they bring you in. Why? Because the best joint-venture targets are being called every single day with that type of basic offer. So you need have a better reason than all the other people calling them to get them to help promote your business.  

Here are 5 big mistakes that people make when they try to find joint-ventures. 

1\. Show up at their events

I have people all the time come to my live events and walk up during a break and ask me if they can have just 5 or 10 minutes of my time to share with me an opportunity they have for me to do business with them. The challenge with that, is my mind is in a completely different space when I have hundreds of business owners in a room and many of them wanting to say something to me during the break. Plus, usually I have to pee which is why we are on a break! It's safe to say that if you approach a speaker at their event and ask them if you can share with them your opportunity, they won't remember you tomorrow which is when you will need them to take some sort of action. 

So what should you do instead?

Remember that environment dictates performance. And get that person into an environment which creating a partnership would be conducive. How can you do that? Well if you want to show up at their events, that's fine. But just give them a gift. Even better yet, say, "I have a gift I would like to give you (as you are holding it), but I realize in this environment you probably don't need one more thing on your hands, so is there a person on your team that I could give this too so they can make sure you receive it later?" The will immediately respect you for respecting their busy, hectic time at an event. Plus, 9 times out of 10 they will point out their personal assistant and now you have a short cut to them later. Give them the gift. Call the assistant the next day and thank him/her for taking the gift and check to see that it was delivered. Then ask to be put through to the person. The reciprocity will be so high at this point, that they would look bad not putting you through. Now you have them in a focused environment where they are used to doing business deals. 

2\. Ask them to sell your products or services

Most of the people who call me to propose a joint venture usually start right out of the gate by asking me if I would be willing to help them sell a product or service. My guess is that they think by jumping straight into the discussion they are being respectful of my time. The problem with this, and I don't want to sound rude, but I could care less about their product or service... at least right now. I probably haven't had the opportunity to experience the product or service to even become a fan. And now I'm being faced with a question to see if I want to take my eye of my companies objective to help out another companies objective. My usual and immediate response to that question will be no. Why would I? You haven't won me over yet.

So what should you do? 

ALWAYS approach a JV by offering to help them out. Maybe start with something like, "I have a loyal client base that I've been developing for over 5 years and I would like to expose all of my customers to your product or service. I've experienced how great your stuff is first hand, and I'm a fan. So I'm calling to see how I can be of a value or service to you." By starting off with this approach you've now got my attention... and my gratitude. In fact, my initial feeling now will be wondering how I can repay you. Here's a quick example of how this works. For my 1 day Brand Accelerator events, I approach business owners all the time and I tell them that I would like to expose their companies services to my customers who are all savvy small business owners. I tell them I want to have them get up on my stage at my event. I want to put my arm around them and tell the whole audience that this is a person who I consider to be a person of influence in the community and I recommend they all reach out right now and put this person's phone numbers into their phone. The response is almost always the same. "Great! Tell me what do I have to do to get on the stage?" And now the door is wide open. My response is also very clear. I say, "I want you to call 10 business owners that you admire and respect. I want you to invite them to my program and tell them you are going, and you think they should too, and if you can get all 10 people to attend, I'll stand up and say those very words, and I'll mean it because only a person of influence would be able to call up 10 respected business owners like that and make it happen." Now the joint-venture wheels are in motion. 

3\. Email them and offer a Mutually Beneficial Relationship

There are just some phrases in the world that, while well-meaning and by all rights are actually quite nice, have been used by so many people over the years that they have become a cliche. I would say "mutually beneficial relationship" has become the new "trust me". It usually turns people off more than turns people on. 

So what should you say?

Pretty much anything else! But here are some of my favorites. 

"I have an opportunity I would like to share with you."

"I would love to become an advocate for your services."

"I'm looking for key people of influence to create an alliance with and I believe you are the kind of person that I would like to have such an alliance." 

"May I share and idea that if we implement would expose your business to over \_\_\_\_ qualified leads?" 

4\. Offering a 50% split with the JV you are trying to win over.
This is probably the most popular form of Joint-Venture offer on the table right now. Especially with internet based products. The challenge with this offer is twofold: \#1 That's the most common offer they hear every day so you've lumped yourself into all of the other people who approach them. The key to getting the best joint-venture clients is to be different than the sea of sameness all over the place. \#2 The best joint-venture prospects out their are probably making so much money right now that they aren't motivated by the same offer that every other person is throwing out. 

So what does a great Joint Venture Partner want?

They want a full and remarkable solution to a very real problem. And if you can honestly say that your product does that, a JV will want to jump on board. So let's explore those criteria for just a moment.

Full and Remarkable Solution: Very simple. If your product does the same thing your competition does, it isn't full and remarkable no matter how much you love it. And you aren't the person to make that call. Your customers are.
A Very Real Problem: Too many entrepreneurs think their product solves a problem that it really doesn't. I've been guilty of this. At one point in my business I developed a speaker training program for professional speakers. It was a 2 week intensive training, combined with 1 year of mentoring. I would develop their websites, and even create and deliver their first product with 1000 unite shipped to their door. If they just sold the product I delivered them at full price it would completely pay for the tuition for the program. No one could argue that it was a full and remarkable solution. The only problem was that most professional speakers don't think they have a problem when it comes to speaking so my audience never felt they needed the training. I often joke now telling people that I created the world best solution for a group of people that didn't have a problem. 

Great Joint Ventures don't want a 50% commission. They want a full and remarkable solution that they can rave about to their current clients and even more importantly, they want someone that will shout at the rooftops how great their products are to people outside their customer base. I would much rather endorse someones product or service and not collect 1 penny in commissions knowing that when the time comes that person who I've helped promote will do the same in return for me. Some of the best joint ventures in the world never share commissions... they just help each other out when the other one needs it.

5\. Picking JVs because you like them. 

I'm not saying that you should work with people you don't like. But I am saying that liking someone should not be the main criteria for working with them. I've seen so many business owners and entrepreneurs create partnerships with people because they like them and then when they get into business they discover that their business acumen, values, work-ethic, and deliverables are completely out of balance. I've been guilty of doing this myself. 

So what criteria should you look for in a JV? 

A good joint-venture partner needs to have 2 of these 3 criteria, as long as you have the remaining third on your side. 

1\. Big Distribution Channels - Ideally you want to partner with someone who is well connected and has a large database of customers and or prospects to reach out to. If they don't have that, then partnering with them to get your name out won't do very much good.

2\. Great Brand Reputation - No matter how successful they are, don't cuddle up to someone else's brand if they are a slime ball. There are tons of very successful and wealthy individuals out there but they have a horrible reputation in the business. Do your background checks. Get personal endorsements from people they know. And if you smell anything fishy... run the other way. 

3\. Hot Products or Services - Just like you want to make sure you have a full and remarkable solution to a very real problem, you want to make sure they do as well. Because if their products aren't selling, there's a good chance they won't be able to sell yours.
